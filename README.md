**Vision-Based Collision Risk Intelligence System**

SentinelDrive is an AI-powered perception platform that detects vehicles and evaluates real-time collision risk using deep learning and computer vision. Designed to simulate core capabilities of modern driver-assistance systems.

## Features

* Real-time vehicle detection
* Collision risk estimation
* Annotated image & video outputs
* Intelligent risk scoring
* Scalable architecture for future perception upgrades

## Dataset

This project is trained and evaluated using the **KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite – Object Detection Dataset**.

- 7,481 training images  
- 3D bounding box annotations  
- Real-world autonomous driving scenarios  
- Vehicle-focused detection classes  

> Note: The dataset is not included in this repository due to size constraints.
